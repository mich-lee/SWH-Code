# Changelog

## [0.2.0] 
### Added features
- Add setup.py for installation
- Added `SLMdisplay.listen_port` to behave as a server that listens to a given port and wait for images to display
- Add `Client` class to communicate from a client to a remote computer using `listen_port`
- Add compression to send images using TCP (bz2, gzip, and zlib)
### Bug correction
- Corrected `SLMdisplay,close()` that made it impossible to re-initialize the SLM after closing it.
